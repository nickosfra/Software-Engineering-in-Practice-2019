#unittesting
This module contains tests for some java files. They check both the functionality and some exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.

## Getting Started
The module was developed in [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/oxygen/3a/eclipse-ide-java-developers) using **Java** as a programming language and **JUnit** as a testing dependency.

### Install
1. Make sure you've installed [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) and [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/oxygen/3a/eclipse-ide-java-developers).
2. Clone this GitHub repository.
3. You will find some txt files (./resources) that are given as inputs to be examined by the tests.

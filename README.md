# Software Engineering in Practice assignments | Spring semester 2019
Assignments which aim to develop small Java applications based on commonly used building tools (Maven) and IDEs (Eclipse).

### Prerequisites
* Use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/ "Maven") to build the project on your local machine. Visit the official [download](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.0/download.cgi "Maven Download") site of The Apache Software Foundation to build it.
* Maven version used: `mvn -version 3.6.0`
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) version used: `java -version 1.8.0_201`

### Projects
* [histogrades](https://github.com/nickosfra/seip2019/tree/development/seip2019/histoGrades): Application that generates a histogram of students' grades. Check the relative [README](https://github.com/nickosfra/seip2019/blob/development/seip2019/histoGrades/README.md) file to find more information about how to build and run it.
* [metricsCalculator](https://github.com/nickosfra/seip2019/tree/development/seip2019/metricsCalculator) : Application that receives a Java file, calculates and presents 3 types of metrics; lines of code, number of classes and numbers of methods used in that file. Check the relative [README](https://github.com/nickosfra/seip2019/blob/development/seip2019/metricsCalculator/README.md) file to find more information about how to build and run it.
